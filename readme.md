#Neo4Jam

I hope this to be a collection of random code while I learn more about [neo4j](http://www.neo4j.com)

###Barabasi-Albert Model
Let's start things off with a study in the [Barabasi-Albert Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barab%C3%A1si%E2%80%93Albert_model)
This generative model is useful in visualizing networks with preferential matching as a primary goal.  The first jam, will generate a model
either from an existing graph db or by creating a new interconnected graph.  I paid strict attention to the probability calculation from
the wikipedia article (linked) as my primary means of deducing probability of the attached node.

Want to build the project?
```bash
gradle installApp
```
